# SOCT-Net: A spiking neural network for OCT segmentation

This repository contains the SNN model of our paper：**A Y-shaped spiking neural network for automatic retinal segmentation**


## 🧠 Overview

We propose **SOCT-Net**, a novel retinal OCT segmentation framework. SOCT-Net leverages **spike-based temporal encoding** to enhance structural feature representation while employing **multi-scale self-attention** for long-range contextual modeling.
